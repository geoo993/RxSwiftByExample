TRAITS

Traits are designed to introduce more context to your code. These Traits are totally optional, using them can really be useful to convey your intensions to readers of your code.

There are 3 Traits (Single, Completable, Maybe)

Single will only either emit a single Next event containing an element or will emit an Error event containing an error.

Completable will only either emit a Completed event or will emit an Error event containing an error, but cannot emit Next events.

Maybe is sort of a match between Single and Completable, it will only emit one event,
which can be a Next event, or a Completed event or an Error event.
